 FSJS project 4

This is the phrase guessing game. 
After pressing 'start button' the program gives user a random phrase to guess.
Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen. A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose). If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears.
A player can guess a letter only once. After theyâ€™ve guessed a letter, this letter is disabled on the onscreen keyboard.

The game is coded by applying the following techniques: vanilla Java Script, DOM interaction and manipulations, object-oriented programming.

User's laptop or computer keyboard is also linked to the interaction (as well as onscreen keyboard).
Extra style changes are made in a styles.css file to style the look of the game page and key buttons.
